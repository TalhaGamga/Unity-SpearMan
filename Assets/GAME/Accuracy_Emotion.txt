To establish a mathematical relationship between Emotion and Accuracy, we need a function where:

When Emotion = 0, Accuracy = 100% (perfect accuracy).
As Emotion increases, Accuracy decreases.
The drop in Accuracy should be non-linear (so higher emotions affect accuracy more severely).

1. Choosing the Equation Type
A good approach is to use an exponential decay or inverse function to create a smooth drop in accuracy.

Equation Model:
Accuracy=100−(M×Emotion)

Where:

k is a scaling factor that determines how fast accuracy drops.
Emotion is between 0 and 1 (normalized).
Accuracy smoothly decreases as Emotion rises.
